## What is Github Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool provided by GitHub, a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It allows you to define custom workflows and automate various tasks within your software development lifecycle. With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repositories.

## Overview of Github Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

GitHub Actions goes beyond just DevOps and lets you run workflows when other events happen in your repository.

For example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.

GitHub provides Linux, Windows, and macOS virtual machines to run your workflows, or you can host your own self-hosted runners in your own data center or cloud infrastructure.

## Components of Github Actions

GitHub Actions consists of several key components that work together to enable automation and workflow execution. These components include:

* **Workflows**: Workflows are the core component of GitHub Actions. They are defined using YAML files and represent a set of steps and actions that execute in response to specific events or triggers. Workflows define the automation logic for your software development processes.

* **Events and Triggers**: Workflows are triggered by specific events that occur within a GitHub repository. Events can include actions such as pushing to a branch, creating or closing a pull request, or scheduling a specific time interval. Triggers determine when a workflow should start.

* **Jobs**: Workflows can contain one or more jobs. Jobs represent a set of steps that execute on the same runner, which is the execution environment for the workflow. Jobs can run concurrently or sequentially, depending on the configuration.

* **Steps**: Steps are individual units of work within a job. Each step performs a specific action or task, such as running a shell command, invoking an action, or interacting with external services. Steps define the order in which actions are executed.

* **Actions**: Actions are standalone units of work that can be reused across different workflows. They are defined in YAML files or Docker containers and encapsulate a specific task or set of operations. Actions can be created by the community or provided by third-party vendors, and they can be used directly within workflows.

* **Runners**: Runners are the compute resources on which jobs and steps in workflows are executed. GitHub provides hosted runners that run workflows on virtual machines in the GitHub Actions infrastructure. You can also set up your own self-hosted runners on your own infrastructure.

* **Environment Variables**: GitHub Actions allows you to define and use environment variables within your workflows. These variables can store information such as access tokens, API keys, or custom configuration values. They can be set at the workflow, job, or step level.

* **Secrets**: Secrets are encrypted variables that can be used to store sensitive information, such as credentials or private keys. Secrets are securely stored and can be accessed by workflows during execution. They are typically used to authenticate with external services or protect sensitive data.
